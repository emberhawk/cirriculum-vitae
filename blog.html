        <h1>Introduction Post</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I am writing a mini blog to give some explaination and understanding on why I created this site , it's purpose and how I intend to use it.</p>
        <p>I was made redundant in August 2020 from my tech support role. Instead of squandering my free time under the coronavirus <span>
          &#129440;</span> restrictions I decided to learn new skills.</p>
        <p>
          My career has not been going anywhere up to this point. I have had a varierty of short term jobs in the tech support sector. I have had a few roles including some volunteering but nothing of any major substance.
          So I decided to relearn a new skillset. I have always been interested in Video Game and I though I could try some game development to see if its a possibility.
          With the remaining redundancy pay I got myself a laptop and bought some Udemy Courses.
          I hear some reviews and there was no real possibility of going back to university or college at this point.
          Also at 36 I doubt that would not be a wise decision, at some point I need to make a living. Also there must be a job role there that could do with my skills.
        </p>
        <p>The following posts will be talking about the courses I have been studying, what I have learned, what it will be usefull for, possibly some code examples and so on. The idea is to clarify a potential employers perspective or decision making into hiring me for a project.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Recently I have been learning all about computer shader and graphics</p>
            <p>I was trying to understand how to make assets and grpahics for games I may utilise down the road.</p>
            <p>I have been studying several courses</p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="#"></a>
              </li>

            <p>This is actually made with just computer fragment shaders and 2 textures in unity. </p>
            <p>I have captured at an angle and it looks quite impressive.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Initially I wasn't targeting game development, I was just trying to fill in gaps in my linux knowledge</p>
        <p>I had some experience with linux in college, then uni and some experiments at home.</p>
        <p>For a while I have distro hopped between windows and linux, I used Ubuntu for a while, then Linux Mint which is a fork of Ubuntu in a way. I tried Arch but found it challenging, I played with fedora after some good reviews</p>
        <p>I kept coming back to windows for gaming to be honest , as I play or used play a lot of video games</p>

        <p>I went through the in no time at all. </p>
        <p>Zihad the lecturer had too much enthusiasm, though was really good</p>
        <p>Some grey aspects of linux were clarified and I found out some new commands</p>

        <h2>Link to: <a class="blog-link" href="https://udemy.com/course/linux-shell-scripting-projects">Linux Shell Scripting</a></h2>
        <br>
        <p>This course basically teaches you about using BASH Shell scripting to optimise administration tasks on linux for administration</p>
        <p>I learned about creating, delete user witha prompt system, daily task getting run with cron</p>
        <p>Running command shell commands over networks</p>
        <p>Surprising I have been using it recently when I installed zsh terminal command line for snazzy command terminals </p>
        <p>Very handy to know, plus more</p>

        <p>This is a very in depth course actually recovering information similar to the linux mastery course I mentioned earlier </p>

        <p>I feel that my maths is strong, and my mental arithmetic is very good on the whole though game development need so much more that a basic understanding</p>
        <p>As silly as this sounds I got to learn alot new things about calculators</p>
        <p>When I was a kid I was too reckless and misbehaving to really take in the education properly</p>
        <p>I learned about the logarithm and factors</p>
        <p>Alot of algrebra, which I think was triggering some sort of PTSD</p>
        <p>I got to relearn and actually understand triginometry (well a more rounded understanding I would say).</p>
        <p>I about adding and multipying matrices</p>
        <p>I got to learn about magnitudes</p>
        <p>I got to enjoy my favorite subject of gimbal lock, quaternions, vectors, cartesian points </p>
        <p>I learned about LERP/ SLERP</p>
        <p>The law of large numbers </p>
        <p>I learned alot more about statistics</p>
        <p>And a whole lot more</p>
